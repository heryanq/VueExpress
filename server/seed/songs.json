    "lyrics": "I backed my car into a cop car the other day\nWell, he just drove off - sometimes life's okay\nI ran my mouth off a bit too much, ah what did I say?\nWell, you just laughed it off and it was all okay\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on anyway, well\nA fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam\nIt was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand\nBad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands\nGood news will work it way to all them plans\nWe both got fired on, exactly, the same day\nWell, we'll float on, good news is on the way\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on okay\nAnd we'll all float on alright\nAlready we'll all float on\nNow don't you worry we'll all float on alright\nAlready we'll all float on alright\nDon't worry we'll all float on\nAlright, Already\nAnd we'll all float on alright\nAlready we'll all float on alright\nDon't worry even if things end up a bit\nToo heavy we'll all float on alright\nAlready, we'll all float on alright\nAlready, we'll all float on okay\nDon't worry, even if things get heavy\nWe'll all float on alright\nAlready, we'll all float on\n(Alright!)\nNow don't you worry, we'll all float on\n(Alright!)\nWe'll all float on"
